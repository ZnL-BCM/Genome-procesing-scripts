# Scripts for genomic processing

This repository contains various individual scripts I have for genomic data processing. I will try to put sufficient description in each script to describe what they do, and will include a brief description in this README as well. 

Please contact me at zianl@bcm.edu if you have any questions. You can use the scripts and/or modify them at will.

## Scripts

* genome_n2bed.c: C script for finding the BED coordinates of all hard-masked (N) nucleotides in a fasta file. Compile before use. 
* genome_cpgs2bed.c: C script for finding BED coordinates of all CG dinucleoties. Very similar to the above script.
